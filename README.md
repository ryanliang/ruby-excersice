Ruby Excercise
==============

In the locker room, there is one wall on which can be installed lockers.

There are two types of lockers, long term rental and daily rental.  An expiry day can be assigned to the long term rental, while the daily one is always set to
expire at the end of today and cannot be changed.

A locker can be assigned to one owner.  Each owner has one name and address.

Code in ruby to represent the above scenerio.  Implement the following methods:

- assign a new owner to a locker that is currently vacant.
- assign a new owner to a locker at given coordinates, if it is currently vacant.
- get the owner's name by the coordinates of the locker on one wall.
- find the locker by a owner's name and return the coordinates of the locker.
- count the number of long term rental lockers.
- count the number of daily rental lockers.
- count the number of vacant lockers.

Unit test the code.
